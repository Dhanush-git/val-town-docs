import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

Email vals get their own email address that you can send email to. When Val Town
receives that email, it triggers the val with the email as its first argument.

:::tip
Vals can send email, too! Using the [email function in the standard library](/std/email)
:::

## Type Signature

Email vals receive an argument called `Email` that represents the email that was sent to the val. Here's an example of an email val:

```ts title="Example"
export async function emailValHandler(email: Email) {
  console.log("Email received!", email.from, email.subject, email.text);
  for (const file of email.attachments) {
    console.log(`Filename: ${file.name}`)
    console.log(`Content Type: ${file.type}`)
    console.log(`Content: ${await file.text()}`)
  };
}
```

The `Email` type has this shape:

```ts
interface Email {
  from: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string | undefined;
  text: string | undefined;
  html: string | undefined;
  attachments: File[];
}
```

## Example

This val forwards any email it receives to me. Try it out by sending an email to `stevekrouse.forwarder@valtown.email`.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/stevekrouse/forwarder" />

## Limitations

:::note[Email size limit]

The total size of inbound emails, including attachments, must be less than 30MB.
