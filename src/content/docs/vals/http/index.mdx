HTTP Vals let you expose an API or website from your val.

They are built on the web-standard
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects,
so are compatible with a number of web frameworks like
[Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Peko](https://github.com/sejori/peko).

These handlers need to export a function that takes a `Request` object
as the first parameter and returns a `Response` object. The function
can be asynchronous.
