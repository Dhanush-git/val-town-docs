import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

You can schedule code to run repeatedly on Val Town. Want to check an RSS
feed every hour, or send a reminder email every day? This is how to do it:
just create a scheduled function and specify when it should run.

- Cron functions can be configured with [cron syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), or simple intervals like "once an hour"
- Functions can run up to once every 15 minutes, or [once a minute, with the Pro plan](https://www.val.town/pricing).

## Type Signature

Cron functions should take an `Interval` object as a parameter, and can return anything as a result. The return value is ignored.

```tsx title="Example" val
export function cronValHandler(interval: Interval) {
  console.log("Cron val ran!");
}
```

The Interval type has the following shape:

```ts
interface Interval {
  lastRunAt: Date | undefined;
}
```

## Schedule types

There are two kinds of schedules: either simple intervals, like "run every two hours",
or you can use cron syntax to define more complex schedules.

You can consult [crongpt.com](https://crongpt.com) for help on writing cron expressions.
For example the following cron runs every two hours, on the first day of the month:

```
0 */2 1 * *
```

:::note[Crons run in UTC]

Cron expressions are evaluated in the [UTC timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time),
so if you want to specify a certain hour in your local timezone, you may need to adjust
the cron expression.

## Example

This example polls an RSS feed for new items since the last run.
