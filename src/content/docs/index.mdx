Val Town is a collaborative website to create and scale Javascript functions. Create APIs, crons, store data – all from the browser, and deployed in miliseconds.

##### What is a val?

- Vals are hosted JavaScript functions
- Vals run on the Val Town serverless platform
- Vals can import other vals, NPM, and more [↗](/reference/import)
- Vals can be public, unlisted, or private [↗](/reference/permissions)
- Vals are run via the Deno runtime [↗](/reference/runtime)
- Vals support JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX

There are **4 types of vals**, each with different _triggers_:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Script"
    description="Triggered manually"
    href="/types/script"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="HTTP"
    description="Triggered by https requests. You can make APIs or websites"
    href="/types/http"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Cron"
    description="Triggered by a timer or cron expression"
    href="/types/cron"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Email"
    description="Triggered by an incoming email"
    href="/types/email"
  />
</CardGrid>

##### Projects [Beta] overview
Vals, while powerful, are limited as single-files. Managing large or interconnected codebases becomes difficult. Projects solve this by allowing you to organize and version multiple related files together.
- **Versioned Workspace:** Projects contain and track changes to vals, files, folders, READMEs with incremental versioning
- **Multiple Entrypoints:** Define multiple HTTP, Cron, and Email vals, each with unique URLs, schedules, and configurations
- **Collaboration Tools:** Fork projects, create branches, sync with upstream
- **Relative Imports:** Import files and folders relative to the project root without needing to adjust paths when branching or forking
- **Static Files:** Add static files (HTML, CSS, text) to projects
- **Scoped Environment Variables:** Project-scoped variables for secure configuration
- **Streamlined Coding:** AI code completion and full-screen IDE with file tree, logs and browser preview
